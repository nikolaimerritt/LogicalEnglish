Language Extensions for code editors are a crucial tool in writing code quickly and without errors. In this project we create a Syntax Highlighter and Language Server for the logical and declarative programming language ``Logical English". We will allow the Language Server to auto-generate ``boilerplate'' template code from rules. We also aim to allow the Language Server to identify type mismatch errors occuring between rules and templates.
