    abstract = { This paper presents an OO style without classes, which we call interface-based object-oriented programming (IB). IB is a natural extension of closely related ideas such as traits. Abstract state operations provide a new way to deal with state, which allows for flexibility not available in class-based languages. In IB state can be type-refined in subtypes. The combination of a purely IB style and type-refinement enables powerful idioms using multiple inheritance and state. To introduce IB to programmers we created Classless Java: an embedding of IB directly into Java. Classless Java uses annotation processing for code generation and relies on new features of Java 8 for interfaces. The code generation techniques used in Classless Java have interesting properties, including guarantees that the generated code is type-safe and good integration with IDEs. Usefulness of IB and Classless Java is shown with examples and case studies. },
